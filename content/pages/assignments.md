The assignments are described below, in Professor Sorensen's own words.

The assignments are deliberately open-ended. It is not specified what the dependent variable should be, what you are trying to explain, etc. Part of the goal of these exercises is to give you practice with working with data, estimating models and making sense of the results. In the language of [15.347](/courses/15-347-doctoral-seminar-in-research-methods-i-fall-2004), I want you to formulate a conceptual model of the data as well as a statistical model. The major constraint is that you apply the method discussed during that week's class (e.g., count models). I will make appropriate datasets available for this purpose, but you are also allowed to use your own data sources.

At the beginning of class in each "Application" week, I ask that you hand in a brief summary of the results of your analysis. This summary should be a maximum of two pages of text, plus any tables and figures, and should discuss the results in light of the conceptual model you have developed. **These assignments may be done in groups of up to two people**. I will ask two or three groups each week to present the results of their work, so that we may discuss them as a class.
